# Firmware Setup Instructions
- Visit https://www.repetier.com/firmware/v092/
- Upload the `repetier-firmware-base-config-v092_9.json` file. You can use these settings to help calibrate your printer and its dimensions later
- Go through the configuration wizard and set the BAUD_RATE to 115200 for compatability with Macs and Windows OS. If you are only using Windows-based OS, you can use 250000.

* If you're having trouble connecting to device in Repeiter Host after installing the printer firmware, ensure your firmware is compiled with a `BAUD_RATE` of `115200`.
